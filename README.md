The Performance Visualization with pandas (or PerfVisPD.py) script was built with a discrete manufacturing environment in mind, and will classify data into one of three user-determined categories (e.g. customer target, internal target, scrap). Given a standard template with known values of component measurement dimensions, the script reads the excel sheet and plots the amounts of components that fall within these boundaries in a pie chart saved as a pdf in the same directory as the active excel sheet.
