The Performance Visualization with pandas (or PerfVisPD.py) script is one that I wrote for an acquaintance of mine who works as an administrator at a Manufacturing firm. The idea is, given a template of data in Microsoft Excel, to visualize the performance of a machine operator within 3 sets of boundaries: Print Specs (the tolerance that the client needs), Target Specs (the smaller tolerance that my friend's company aims for), and scrap (parts that are outside of both boundaries.) The script reads the excel sheet and plots the 3 categories in a pie chart which is saved as a .pdf in the directory address where the excel sheet is saved.
